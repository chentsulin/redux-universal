# Redux-Universal

## Initiative

[React] is popular, [Redux] is awesome. And what makes them more awesome is the ability to do [Universal Apps]. However, people choose technologies differently and I found it really hard to communicate with others without a common view. So I decide to share my current technologies stack with you guys and, happy coding!

## What would we build?

I'll try to build a very simple **forum**. So there will be a list of forums and under the forum, the user can see a list of post. Of course, the user may click on the post and go into the post page. This application is an [Universal App] so that means when you use [curl] to get the page, you'll get meaningful response, too!

The data is fetch from an separate API server. We won't implement that part but I think there should be enough tuturials/services to build your own API server. Oh, the forum should support search over posts. So it sounds like a typical website, hugh?

I will try to write this [README.md] sections with corresponding git commit changes. So a new section on this page will map to a new commit in git history. That is, I will constantly do `git rebase -i 2aed179e10` against the initial commit to make it more senseble when read from the git history.
